            <b>Overview</b>
            <br>
            The Skagit Alpine Club usually runs an 8 week Basic Mountaineering Course
            annually. The course typically covers basic rock climbing and mountaineering
            skills. However, due to the global pandemic, our regular 8 week course will
            not be offered. We will offer individual one-week courses that can be taken
            separately or together, equal to the first four weeks of our typical course.
            This is to provide increased safety for students and instructors and
            continue to offer opportunities for students to learn basic rock and snow
            skills in small groups.

            <b>Course Offerings</b>
            <br>
            Each course can be registered for separately, and includes one weekday
            evening session to introduce skills and cover important information,
            followed by a weekend day trip to practice skills in the field. Weekday
            sessions will be located outdoors, and undercover as much as possible.
            Weekend sessions will typically be planned for Saturday, but will be weather
            dependent and may be moved to Sunday. Participants will be registered for
            one session that includes a weekday session and weekend outing of the same
            week. Participants must show basic skills competence during weekday session
            prior to weekend outing.

            <b>Fitness Levels</b>
            Each outing will be physically demanding and requires strong hiking fitness
            and endurance. We recommend that all students have weeks of regular hiking
            experience with more than 1,000ft of elevation gain each hike. Strength
            training experience is also recommended.

            the cost of each course to $180. Registering for all four courses (Rock 1 &
