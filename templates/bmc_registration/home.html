            <b>Fitness Levels</b>
            <br>
            Each outing will be physically demanding and requires strong hiking fitness and endurance. We recommend that
            all students engage in several weeks of regular hiking experience with more than 1,000ft of elevation gain
            each hike prior to starting the course. Strength training experience is also recommended. Participants
            participating in the 8 week course should be able to carry 30lbs up the Pine & Cedar Trail in the Chuckanuts
            in under 1 hour and 30 minutes.
        </p>

            <b>COVID Notice</b>
            <br>
            All courses are subject to change based on CDC guidelines. If courses are cancelled based on COVID
            restrictions, a full refund will be provided. CDC guidelines will be followed throughout courses, and
            students may be asked to leave without refund if not adhering to policies. Students will be asked to
            complete a COVID Waiver to acknowledge policies prior to course start.
        </p>
        <p class="block">
            <b>Cancellation & Refund Policy</b>
            <br>
            Payment required in full at time of registration. After registration, full refunds are available until two
            weeks prior to the start of the first course date. No refunds available after two weeks before first course
            date. For the safety of all, students experiencing any possible symptoms of COVID or exposed to anyone with
            COVID symptoms should report them immediately. Students will get a full refund or transfer to a later course
            if an isolated quarantine period is required.

        </p>
        <p class="block">
