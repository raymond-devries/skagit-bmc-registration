            <b>Fitness Levels</b>
            <br>
            Each outing will be physically demanding and requires strong hiking fitness and endurance. We recommend that
            all students engage in several weeks of regular hiking experience with more than 1,000ft of elevation gain
            each hike prior to starting the course. Strength training experience is also recommended. Participants
            participating in the 8 week course should be able to carry 30lbs up the Pine & Cedar Trail in the Chuckanuts
            in under 1 hour and 30 minutes.
